# Choosing an editor

Coding an HTML page does not require any special tools. It's entirely possible to write a valid HTML, CSS, or JavaScript document using a bare-bones 
text editor such as Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on macOS). Doing so makes it much easier to make mistakes, though, since neither of those 
editors provide any kind of syntax highlighting or tools to point out typos. As such, we don't recommend going this route.

Fortunately, there are many programs available which are built specifically for writing code, most of which are free or have a free version (usually 
with a reduced feature set as compared to the paid version). We'll cover two options below which are available for every desktop operating system - 
_Visual Studio Code_ and _WebStorm_.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code, also known as VSCode, (not to be confused with the Visual Studio IDE) is a simplified, multi-language code editor from Microsoft, available 
for free at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/). No license is needed to download and install VSCode, and it comes with built-in 
support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can continue using VSCode for other courses as well, like CIS-117 (Java) and CIS-127 (C/C++), by installing one or 
more extensions.

## WebStorm

WebStorm is an IDE (integrated development environment) from JetBrains, available for download at [https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). 

WebStorm is a commercial software application, but JetBrains offers free licenses to student and educators. You can acquire a student license by visiting 
[https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) and clicking the **Apply now** button. You'll use your 
student email address (yourname@email.grcc.edu) to create an account, and once you've verified your email address you'll have access to WebStorm (and other IDEs) as long as 
you are a student.

One major bonus to choosing WebStorm over Visual Studio Code is that WebStorm comes with an embedded web server. This allows you to "run" your web pages in the same manner 
as Raider (or any other web server), which can be helpful to find issues such as using the wrong path format for linked files and images (a very common mistake for new and experienced developers alike).

## Additional Options

### SublimeText

SublimeText ([https://www.sublimetext.com/](https://www.sublimetext.com/)) is a code editor very similar in function to Visual Studio Code. Using SublimeText in a commercial environment requires a paid license, but the editor will run indefinitely on an evaluation license, making it a reasonable choice to experiment with during your GRCC coursework.

### Notepad++

Notepad++ ([https://notepad-plus-plus.org/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)) is another code editor very similar in function to Visual Studio Code. <b>This editor is only available for the Windows operating system</b>.
